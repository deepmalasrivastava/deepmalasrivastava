Welcome to my Data Scientist Portfolio! This repository showcases the various projects, analyses, and machine learning models I have worked on as a data scientist. Here, you will find examples of data exploration, data visualization, and predictive modeling using various datasets. 

Project1: Book Recommendation System
Developed a book recommendation system using memory and model based collaborative filtering by utilising the ratings of books and the various user features. Analyzed and cleaned the User-Book-Rating dataset, performed feature engineering to ensure an accurate and efficient recommendation system. Implemented Singular Value Decomposition based Matrix Factorization to obtain user-item interactions and employed cosine distance to measure useritem.Identified SVD as the best-performing model with an RMSE of 0.30 and MAE of 0.20, which can increase user engagement and drive business growth in industries where recommendation systems play a crucial role.

Project2:E-mail Campaign Effectiveness Prediction
Developed a classification model to characterize the mail and track the mail that is ignored, read, acknowledged by the reader using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees and XG Boost algorithm. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and using statistical methods and treated outliers. Applied SMOTE on training data to mitigate the class imbalance in dataset. The metrics used for comparing the models are: Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F1 score for both train and test data to check cases of overfitting

Project 3:Yes Bank Stock Closing Price Prediction
Developed a Regression model to predict the stock closing price of next month using Linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression and ElasticNet Regression. Ridge regression’s and ElasticNet performance improved by applying cross validation and Hyperparameter tuning. Employed techniques such as feature transformation ,feature construction and feature scaling. Compared different models. Obtained R2 and Adjusted R2 are around 95% and 91% in each model.
